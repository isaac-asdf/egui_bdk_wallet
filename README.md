# A new Bitcoin wallet leveraging the power of BDK!

This project aims to be a light wrapper on top of bdk. Making cutting edge wallet capabilities graphically accessible (or customizable by any dev) in a simple Rust UI will hopefully allow this project to become useful for niche scenarios.


***This should go without saying, but do not put real money in here. I will not be testing on mainnet any time soon.***
